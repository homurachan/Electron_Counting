Electron counting programs for Falcon III camera.


# Examples of raw image stacks
Single frame of 120/300kV raw images are presented in this repository. Here are two stacks below.

300kV with beamstopper, 39 frames, total of ~0.6 electron/pixel: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TUbeOKZ7Tx7fzq2Qfe5FUalItxrLSZ4H/view?usp=sharing

120kV with beamstopper, 39 frames, total of ~0.5 electron/pixel: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_24qEJvVAFiN6JNh5zNT0zrpKlpY-TW6/view?usp=sharing

As for the raw images of our datasets, we may gradually upload them to EMPIAR-CHINA. Since each dataset occupies more than 10TB of storage space, it would take forever to upload. You can contact the corresponding author and send us hard disks to get a copy of dataset.
